.SH NAME
.PP
\fBcrypto-box-open\fP \- verify and decrypt a stream of data using asymmetric (public-key) cryptography
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B crypto-box-open [ \fIpublickeyfile\fP ] [ \fIsecretkeyfile\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reads a stream of encrypted data from standard input, and decrypts it using public-key authenticated cryptography from \fINaCl\fP (the Networking and Cryptography library). Specifically, the encrypted data from standard input is expected to be of the format output by crypto-box(1).
.PP
The \fIpublickeyfile\fP argument should point to a file with the public key of the intended message recipient.  If this argument is not given, the environment variable \fBNACL_PUBLICKEY_FILE\fP will be used instead.
.PP
The \fIsecretkeyfile\fP argument should point to a file with the secret key of the message sender. If this argument is not given, the environment variable \fBNACL_SECRETKEY_FILE\fP will be used instead.
.SH EXIT CODE
.PP
Normally, \fBcrypto-box-open\fP exits with \fB0\fP. 
.PP
If invalid arguments are given, \fBcrypto-box-open\fP exits with \fB100\fP.
.PP
If an error occurs, \fBcrypto-box-open\fP exits with \fB111\fP.
.SH CRYPTOGRAPHY
.PP
This program is a simply a wrapper around the crypto_box_open function provided by \fBNaCl\fP, the Networking and Cryptography library by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange. See the official website \fIhttp://nacl.cr.yp.to/\fP for details.
